## 🎯 Project Background
In PC web-based instant messaging scenarios, standardized message templates can greatly improve reply efficiency and maintain content consistency. However, templates are often scattered across documents, spreadsheets, or chat records, and sometimes rely on personal memory. As business needs evolve, the variety of templates increases, making them hard to find, difficult to manage, and prone to version inconsistencies.

Speech Repo was developed to address these issues: it centralizes frequently used replies, organizes them with categories and tags, and provides one-click copy functionality—so templates are always ready when needed, without hunting through files or relying on memory.

## ✨ Features
  - Add, edit, and delete frequently used templates
  - One-click copy of any template, ready to paste on any PC web page
  - Customizable category structure with tags for precise search
  - Mini window mode
  - Multi-language support
  - Other features under development

## 🚀 Technical Highlights
 - Lightweight design: Only 2MB, minimal impact on browser performance
 - Offline support: Local storage mechanism, no network dependency
 - Data security: Local encrypted storage to protect sensitive information
